                    <h3>Sharon Kwikiriza</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the bustling world of global connectivity, where moving to a new city can be both thrilling and challenging, Sharon 
                        envisioned a platform that goes beyond relocation logistics. As one of the visionary founders of FriendlyFace, Sharon 
                        believes in fostering genuine connections to transform the experience of settling in a new place.

                    <p>
                        I am a student studying at the Hochschule Furtwangen (HFU). Through my studies, I got in contact with the organization and found the idea compelling and interesting. 
                        Since I grew up in the area, I was more familiar with the place than some of the people who were studying with me, so I experienced first-hand how challenging it can be to move to a new place.

                    <h3>Alyssa Smith</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a student at Hochschule Furtwangen and have lived in Germany for a few years now. 
                        Moving to here made me realize how much help many people need when they move, especially to a completely new country where there are so many new things. 
                        The formation of FriendlyFace is the creation of the help I wish I had when moved, 
                        I hope we are able to help those who need it in the Freiburg area.

                    <h3>Nashitah Zainab</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a student at Hochschule Furtwangen, originally from Pakistan. I decided to join this organization 
                        because, upon moving here, I noticed that people encounter challenges in certain areas, and I am eager to assist others. 
                        Residing in the Black Forest has heightened my enthusiasm for exploration, whether 
                        it's appreciating its picturesque landscapes or immersing myself in the diverse cultural experiences it provides.
