                <h3>Michael</h3>
                <p>
                    "At first, I was really nervous about moving to a place where I didn't know anyone or anything.
                    So, I was truly grateful when I came across this service. It connected me with a really nice person who,
                    after exchanging messages, helped me feel more at ease. 
                    When I first met my helper, I wasn't sure what to expect, but they really assisted me in becoming familiar with the
                    area. They showed me all the important places, like stores, the hospital, and some enjoyable sightseeing spots.
                    Overall, it made moving to an unfamiliar place much more relaxed and calm."

                <h3>Stephen</h3>
                <p>"I moved to Freiburg and the helper from FriendlyFace was very nice and knowledgeable about the
                    things I needed to do and sign at the government office. She also helped me find a new apartment
                    and showed me how to navigate the city on my own."

                <h3>Rebecca</h3>
                <p>"My husband and I moved to Villingen with our child right before he started school. The helper from FriendlyFace
                    helped us find which schools were available for our child to go to and explained how the German school system
                    functions. We had already found an apartment but the helper offered to help us before they knew that.
                    They also helped us at the Ausländerbehörde and recommended some nearby doctors."
